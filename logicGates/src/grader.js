/* So here's how this is going to go. This is going to take in three things.
- The student submission (using both the final results, as well as the number of each gate that is used.)
- The teacher desired results
- The teacher specifications (the number of gates of each type that are expected. )
-- These specifications will not be shown to the student, so they do not try to create the final result and then just add gates to match the specs
- And then it will make sure everything matches up.*/
