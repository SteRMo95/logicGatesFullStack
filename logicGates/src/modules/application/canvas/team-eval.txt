Probably the second most interactive and engaged.  Takes initiative but that has tapered off towards the latter half.

Easily the most interactive and engaged, trying to get things moving and lead stuff. Closest thing we have to a leader right now.

Really doesn't talk or say much, not contributing much if anything in work or ideas.  I hate to be blunt but you hardly know he's there to be honest.

Passive and a listener, doesn't add much in communication unless specifically prompted.  However, does decent work and overall an asset, and built 
our page layout when we asked him to.  Just wish he'd be more proactive and talk and communicate more.

Difficult combination of good and bad.  Talented, but forceful in advocacy for strange things like being vehemently opposed to using libraries (What???) 
and at one point claimed explicitly false things about React.js because he was invested in just using vanilla javascript.  I think what he likes when he 
codes is building absolutely *everything* from the ground up to either have micropscopic control over all aspects and/or to have the pride of everything 
from top to bottom being his brainchild.  And that is cool and admirable, and he has built some impressive stuff on his own time, but it is unfortunately 
antithetical to the process of software engineering and this has caused us problems, particularly in the first half of the semester as we struggled to try to 
figure things out, and things got somewhat frustrating.  He is a great coder, detail oriented, and can produce designs and ideas out of his head literally 
faster than I can even keep up, but I think he has to adapt to the way industry works and to learn to be less emotionally invested in specific technologies 
and coding minutiae so his clear talents can shine through in the professional settings and roles where he is working with others.
